(Currently at 1km/6mins).\r\n\r\n* What am I currently reading ? - The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg\r\n\r\n* Creating and maintaining a book review section on this website.\r\n\r\n* Studying the machine learning packages on python. \"sklearn\". Simultaneously,start working on kaggle datasets. \r\n\r\n* What is keeping me awake ? - Implementing my own Football statistical index to forecast player performance for the upcoming weeks.\r\n\r\n* Trying to be up-to-date with this course on coursera: \"The Power of Macroeconomics: Economic Principles in the Real World\" \r\n\r\nMuch more to be added soon.  \r\n",
